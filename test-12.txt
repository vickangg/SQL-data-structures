 It creates a table with 4 columns and they all have different type. 
 Then I insert some rows to it and I also have one command inserting a row 
 to a table that does not exist in the database. I add print from where with 
 different combinations of colname and op, including invalid colname, after 
 inserting row. Then I create another table and do a join two table where the 
 int value matches. Then I do some delete demand on both table with where 
 colname = something. I really don't know which part finds the bug 8 and 15 
 but hope it can help you.

CREATE table 4 string bool int double random yes twenty point
INSERT INTO table 5 ROWS
coffee true 20 23.4
drink true 13 24.5
snack false 10 89.432
cookie true 15 43.21
fruit true 14 54.32
INSERT INTO nonexistent 3 ROWS
PRINT FROM table 2 random yes WHERE yes = true
PRINT FROM table 2 random twenty WHERE point < 50.32
PRINT FROM table 2 point yes WHERE random > print
PRINT FROM table 2 twenty point WHERE twenty = 10
INSERT INTO table 2 ROWS
hit true 32 48.32
block false 42 192.0
PRINT FROM table 2 trick yes WHERE twenty > 12
CREATE table2 string bool int double random2 yes2 twenty2 point2
INSERT INTO table 5 ROWS
drink true 20 23.4
trick true 13 24.5
coffee false 10 89.432
brownie true 15 43.21
cookie true 14 54.32
JOIN table AND table2 WHERE twenty = twenty2 AND PRINT 3 yes 1 yes2 2 twenty 1
DELETE FROM table WHERE point = 43.21
DELETE FROM table WHERE point = 39209.23
DELETE FROM table2 WHERE random2 = coffee
DELETE FROM table2 WHERE twenty2 = 20
QUIT
